JavaScript was heavily tested during development of this project. Some skills developed during this include:

- for loops <br>
- if else statements <br>
- for...of statement <br>
- adding eventlisteners and using data from the event to determine which functions to call. <br>
- Writing well organized code, creating functions where necessary for readability. <br>
- usage of many array functions. <br>
- usage of string functions. <br>

This project is mostly finished. Keyboard support will be added and is being worked on right now.
